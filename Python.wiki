        - Start the server in some terminal window:
            python /usr/local/xpdb/Xsrcwin.py port_number
        - Use 2000 for port_number
        - Start your PDB sessions from the directory containing your debuggee.
            python /usr/local/xpdb/Xpdb.py debuggee_full_path_name debuggee_command_line_arguments
        - Within PDB, issue the command
            startsrcwin port_number
        - Now use PDB as usual. Your source code appears in the server window, with your current line marked by 'N'.
